#Universal SDL3
Introducing my universal SDL3 project, with the sheer intention on allowing others to build cross-platform applications without the headache of dealing with multiple platforms.

So far, this SDL3 project has the following support (but not limited to):
- OpenGL
- Vulkan
- SDL3
- SDL3_image
- SDL3_ttf
- Sqlite3 
- FFMPEG

I cannot ensure that the libraries have full functionality, so please report to me any particular issues you may find if you decide to use this repo.
