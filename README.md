#Universal SDL3
    Hello, welcome to a Universal SDL3 Application project repo!!!! Ever
since I began working with this library, one of the biggest hassles is
to get dynamic linking without it being a system limiting factor. Often,
absolute paths are required if you go about doing a simple Makefile. So
instead, I've decided to wrap this into a Docker container with the hopes
that it makes someone's life easier.

    What I want to add to this repo are a lot of the foundational libraries
that often go hand in hand, however, this may take quite a bit of time to
accomplish. 

Here is a list of things I am focused on implementing that's third party, 
in order of priority:
    1. SDL3
    2. SDL3_image
    3. SDL3_ttf
    4. SDL3_mixer
    5. FFmpeg
    6. JUCE
    7. SQLite
